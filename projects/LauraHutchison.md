## Project Description
Moving to a new country is a difficult prospect. One potentially stressful area affected is healthcare - migrating means having to reestablish and assert your healthcare needs. 

This project sought to better understand the effects of sharing stories in healthcare on a digital platform among migrants in the UK. While digital story sharing platforms exist in the form of curated websites and online health communities for chronic health conditions, there is little in the way of migrants and culturally diverse people. 

## Project Findings
Reactions to the website were largely positive. Nearly all participants learned something after using the website, from more insight to the experiences of other migrants or how certain conditions may be approached. Approximately half of users reported some level of self-identification with the stories. The inclusion of resources aimed at migrants was reported as generally useful.
