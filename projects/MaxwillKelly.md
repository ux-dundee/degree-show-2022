## Subtitle

A car companion application to analyse the charging patterns of Electric Vehicles (EVs).

## Connecting to EVs

Modern road vehicles are in constant communication with the cloud via cellular antennae. We use the third-party API Smartcar which allows us to connect to 24 vehicle brands and over 112 million vehicles. 

## Application features

When an EV is connected a user can perform basic tasks such as view information about their EV’s range and battery status, lock/unlock their vehicle and view their position relative to their vehicle on a map.

## Recording data

When an EV is connected, our back-end API records the battery status and location of the EV and the mobile application records the user’s location at set time intervals.
